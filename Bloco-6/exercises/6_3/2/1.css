Your job is to stop the incoming enemies from getting past your defenses. Unlike other tower defense games, you must position your towers using CSS!

We'll start with container properties. A flexbox container has a main axis and a cross axis.

Use the justify-content property on the tower group container to move your towers into effective positions. justify-content positions a container's items along the main axis and accepts the following values:

    flex-start: group items at the start of a container's main axis
    flex-end: group items at the end of the main axis
    center: group items in the center of the main axis
    space-between: evenly distribute items along the main axis such that the first item aligns at the start and the final item aligns at the end
    space-around: evenly distribute items along the main axis such that all items have equal space around them

Try justify-content: center; for example, to move the container's towers to the center of the main axis.
